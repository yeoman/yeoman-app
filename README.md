### Getting Started

**Node v0.10.x is required!**

1. `script/bootstrap` - Run this once per checkout.
2. `script/build` - Run this whenever you change package.json or change early startup code
3. `script/run` - Run the app. Use this for running the app in developer mode

Another useful script is `script/grunt`, which will run the local version of Grunt. `script/grunt --help` will tell you the list of available tasks.
