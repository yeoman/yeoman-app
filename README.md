Yo, my friend. This is the first official Yeoman application with a fresh user interface from 2015. The app is unfortunately still in heavy development and **we are looking for help!** Let us know if something doesn't work like you expected by raising an issue or fix it straight away with a PR.

## Documentation

The project is based mainly on [electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Material UI](http://material-ui.com/). For a Getting started guide, API docs etc. see the [documentation page](./docs). If something is missing, wrong or unclear, please open an issue. Thank you!

## Google analytics

To understand how the app is being used we will report usage information to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics). If you do not want this information reported, you can disable it. Open the devtools with <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows) and execute following snippet in the console `localStorage.setItem('insight.disabled', true)`.
